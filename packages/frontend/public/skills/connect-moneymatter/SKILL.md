# Connect an AI agent to MoneyMatter

MoneyMatter exposes a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Connecting an
agent to this server gives the agent OAuth-secured access to the user's
financial data (accounts, transactions, budgets, subscriptions, transaction
automations, categories, tags, cash flow, balance history, investment
portfolios, holdings, and investment transactions). The agent can read these
records and — when the user grants the corresponding scopes — create, edit,
and delete them.

Use this skill when the user asks to "connect Claude to my budget", "hook up
ChatGPT to MoneyMatter", "let my AI see my finances", or similar.

## Endpoints

- **MCP transport**: `https://mcp.moneymatter.app/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)
- **Server card**: <https://moneymatter.app/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json>
- **OAuth Authorization Server metadata**: <https://moneymatter.app/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server>
- **OAuth Protected Resource metadata**: <https://moneymatter.app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource>

## OAuth scopes

| Scope            | Purpose                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `finance:read`   | Read accounts, transactions, budgets, subscriptions, analytics  |
| `finance:write`  | Create and edit transactions, budgets, subscriptions, and more  |
| `finance:delete` | Permanently delete records (transactions, budgets, portfolios…) |
| `profile:read`   | Read the user's profile (name, email, base currency)            |
| `offline_access` | Receive a refresh token so sessions survive expiration          |

The MoneyMatter consent screen lets the user grant or deny `finance:write` and
`finance:delete` independently. Always request the narrowest set of scopes
sufficient for the job — read-only agents should not request write or delete.
Users can revoke a connected app at any time from the MoneyMatter settings
page.

## Setup steps (Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, ChatGPT, OpenClaw)

1. Ensure the user has a MoneyMatter account. If not: direct them to
   <https://moneymatter.app/sign-up>.
2. In the agent client, add a new MCP server using the URL
   `https://mcp.moneymatter.app/mcp`.
3. The client discovers the OAuth authorization server from the
   `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` endpoint automatically.
4. The client opens a browser window for the user to sign in and authorize
   the requested scopes. The user grants consent in the MoneyMatter UI.
5. On success, the agent receives tokens and can list the tools exposed by
   the server (see below).

Call `get_user_profile` **first** — it reveals the user's base currency, which
is required to interpret `ref*` fields (refAmount, refBalance) that normalize
multi-currency data.

## Data conventions

- All monetary amounts are decimals (e.g. `42.50` means $42.50), not cents.
- Fields prefixed with `ref` are converted to the user's base currency.
  Use them for cross-account totals when accounts have different currencies.
- Transaction types: `income`, `expense`, `transfer`. Transfers are **not**
  income or expense — exclude them from spend/earn aggregations.
- File bytes never travel through MCP tool arguments. To attach a receipt, call
  `create_attachment_upload_url`, then POST each file as the raw request body to
  the returned `url` with the returned headers plus the file's URI-encoded name in
  the `filenameHeader` header (needs shell/HTTP access to the file).
- Investment vs regular transactions are **separate datasets**.
  `search_transactions` returns regular (spending) transactions; investment
  activity (buy/sell/dividend/fee) lives in `get_investment_transactions` and
  does not appear in `search_transactions`.
- Transaction automations are rules evaluated top to bottom by `position` on
  new transactions on bank-connected accounts or imported rows — never on
  transfers, planned ones, or transactions on manual (non-bank) accounts. Existing
  transactions change only when the user runs "Apply to past transactions" for a
  saved rule in the app. The first rule that applies an action wins. Test conditions with `preview_transaction_automation` before
  saving a rule, and pass the full current id set to
  `reorder_transaction_automations`.
- Portfolio queries are gated by `portfolioId`. Call `get_portfolios` first
  to discover ids before calling `get_portfolio_summary`,
  `get_portfolio_holdings`, or `get_portfolio_balances`.
- Portfolio cash moves via transfers: `link_transaction_to_portfolio` when the
  bank transaction already exists, `transfer_account_to_portfolio` /
  `transfer_portfolio_to_account` to create the transaction alongside the
  transfer, `create_portfolio_cash_transaction` when no account is involved.
- Fixed-income positions (fixed deposits, bonds, peer loans) are a separate,
  event-sourced dataset from investment transactions. `create_fixed_income_position`
  auto-creates the position's `initial_investment` event; every later cash
  movement — interest payout, repayment, maturity, writedown, fee — is a
  separate `create_fixed_income_event` call against that `positionId`.

## Troubleshooting

- **OAuth consent screen doesn't appear**: confirm the client fetched
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and is using the advertised
  `authorization_endpoint`.
- **401 Unauthorized on tool calls**: the access token expired. The client
  should use the refresh token (granted via `offline_access` scope) to obtain
  a new access token.
- **Revoking access**: user goes to MoneyMatter → Settings → AI → Connectors (MCP)
  and removes it from Active connectors.

## Self-hosted deployments

Users who self-host will have their own MCP URL (e.g. `https://mcp.my-domain.tld/mcp`).
Ask the user for their deployment URL before assuming the public endpoint.
