   * IMPORTANT: Investment transactionType Logic
   *
   * The relationship between `category` and `transactionType` represents CASH FLOW direction:
   *
   * BUY transactions:
   * - category: INVESTMENT_TRANSACTION_CATEGORY.buy
   * - transactionType: TRANSACTION_TYPES.expense
   * - Logic: You are SPENDING money to purchase securities (cash leaves your account)
   * - Example: Buy 100 shares of Apple for $15,000 → Your account balance DECREASES
   *
   * SELL transactions:
   * - category: INVESTMENT_TRANSACTION_CATEGORY.sell
   * - transactionType: TRANSACTION_TYPES.income
   * - Logic: You are RECEIVING money from selling securities (cash enters your account)
   * - Example: Sell 100 shares of Apple for $17,000 → Your account balance INCREASES
   *
   * This might seem counterintuitive since you're "losing" shares when selling, but the
   * transactionType tracks the CASH FLOW, not the security movement. Think of it from
   * your bank account's perspective - selling securities brings money IN (income).
